# Section 5 â€“ Refactoring Code Smells in Practice

This activity is designed to help you practice identifying code smells and applying refactoring patterns to a real codebase in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns.

In order to make the code easier to read and smell less I refactored some of its components. I changed variable names such as a,b, and c because these were Mysterious Names. These names made it unclear as to what the purpose of the varible was. Another thing that I noticed was Redundant Comments. Comments on things like counter++ are unnecessary because they don't give new information.
